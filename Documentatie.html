                <h4>2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints</h4>
                <p>
                    Most of the constraints are directed towards the smart fridge application. In order to complete and make purchases, it is necessary to be connected to the app on the phone or tablet, where the corresponding user information is stored. This action is done through the QR code.
